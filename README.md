To my knowledge, all aspects of this assignment have been implemented correctly.
My personal website contains a resume and biography page, and is located
in my personal Git repo. The website can be accessed through my Tufts CS personal website. I discussed aspects of the project with Jason Payne, but
worked mostly alone on this assignment. It took me approximately 5-6 hours to
complete the assignment.
